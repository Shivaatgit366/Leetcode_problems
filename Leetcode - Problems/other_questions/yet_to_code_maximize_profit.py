# Harry is a thief, he loots a house. He has a sack with maximum weight capacity of "W".
# there are "N" items in the house, each item has weight "wt".
# each item has value "v" which he will get when he sells the item.
# Harry can not break any item, either he can take full item or leave it (0-1 property).

# values - this array contains value of each item when sold
# weights - this array contains weight of each item
# n/N - total number of items
# w/W - capacity of the sack

# values: [1, 2, 3]
# weights: [4, 5, 1]
# n: 3
# w: 4

# output: 3 (Harry can only pick up item with weight 1 having value 3)


# solution:-


class Solution:
    def maximize_profit(self, values: list[int], weights: list[int], N: int, W: int) -> int:
        return 33
